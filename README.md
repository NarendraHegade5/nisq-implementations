# NISQ Implementations

A curated list of algorithm implementations on noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. Implemented algorithms are ordered chronologically and include architecture (e.g., superconducting), number of qubits, and references.

# Contributions

Please submit pull requests with algorithm implementations not included below. Any and all corrections are welcome. References to open-access journals (e.g., arXiv) are preferred in all cases, if available. Markdown table generators such as [https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables]() may be useful.
